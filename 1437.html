<h1>Word of the Day</h1>
<p>Ok thank goodness you made it here LOL <br>
I honestly wasnâ€™t sure if those were the only Pokemon pfps we had and I knew you guys would be really annoying if I misremembered and it fucked up the answer.  <br>
Anyways I really like the Word of the Day bit from the Yard extended universe so I made my own, except you guys have to find the words of the day and put them in here <br>
to get much needed info!</p>
