<h1>Congratulations!</h1>
<p id="firstp">You guys figured out the first clue! <br> Something is wrong here though. <br>
We all need to be on the right page. Luckily, <em> some of us in PBI have shared something in common with me </em> that will help us get there. <br>
It is important to stay present, but since we change over time, for the next puzzle donâ€™t forget the past.  <br> 
Once you figure out all four answers, just add them up!</p>

<p> Just to help give you some ideas, some clues are simple ciphers and pattern recognition, some are PBI related, some are emoji related, etc.  <br> 
    I even learned a simple steganography trick to make this ARG, but don't worry I didn't embed any secret messages in images or gifs on the pages of this website <br> 
    (note: I am not lying about this, you do not need to search through the file data of the discord screenshots on this page lol that would be awful).</p>
