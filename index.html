<h1>Congratulations!</h1>
<p>You guys figured out the first clue! <br> Something is wrong here though. <br>
We all need to be on the right page. Luckily, some of us in PBI have shared something in common with me that will help us get there. <br>
It is important to stay present, but since we change over time, for the next puzzle donâ€™t forget the past.  <br> 
Once you figure out all four answers, just add them up!</p>
